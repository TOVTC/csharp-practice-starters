C# is an object-oriented programming language. The four basic principles of object-oriented programming are: <br/>
*   Abstraction Modeling the relevant attributes and interactions of entities as classes to define an abstract representation of a system.
*   Encapsulation Hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and only allowing access through a public set of functions.
*   Inheritance Ability to create new abstractions based on existing abstractions.
*   Polymorphism Ability to implement inherited properties or methods in different ways across multiple abstractions.
